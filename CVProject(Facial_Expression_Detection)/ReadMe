This documentation provides a complete overview of the facial expression recognition project. The system is capable of detecting and classifying facial expressions from both static images and real-time video feeds. The project uses Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to achieve this functionality. Further improvements could include optimizing the model, expanding the range of detectable expressions, or integrating this system into a larger application.
